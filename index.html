               <h2>IDLES in Nashville, TN</h2>
               <details>
                  <p>In September of 2018, me and 3 friends took a trip to Nashville to see one of my favorite bands, IDLES, play at the <a href=https://www.tnvacation.com/local/nashville-high-watt>High Watt</a>. We also stopped by <a href=https://thirdmanrecords.com/pages/nashville-store>Third Man Records</a>, which is one of <a href="#jackwhite">Jack White's</a> storefronts/recording booths/live venues, where I picked up a couple White Stripes records and posters! The show was one of the most memorable I have been to, IDLES always bring a lot of energy and enthusiasm, and the room was full of people dancing and laughing. I have gone to a couple more IDLES shows since and it has always been the same great energy.</p>

               <h2>Fleet Foxes at the Stifel Theatre </h2>
               <details>
                  <p>In May of 2018, my fiance and I saw Fleet Foxes perform at what was then the Peabody Opera House but has since become the <a href=https://www.stifeltheatre.com/>Stifel Theatre</a>. This is a beautiful theatre, it was built in 1934 and has been maintained and upgraded well along the way. The acoustics were also phenomenal, which was perfect for a Fleet Foxes show, as they have a lot of people on stage contributing to a pretty big sound. The show was relaxing and cathartic, Fleet Foxes invokes a lot of calm introspection and have a way of making music that feels like nature, or different seasons. All in all, a very memorable experience, and I was glad to see them at such a great theatre. </p>

               <h2>Jack White at the <a href=http://thehollywoodcasinoamphitheatre.com/>Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre</a></h2>
               <details>
                  <p class="fun-paragraph">It was so great to get to see one of my all time favorite artists in 2022, just after spending so much time at home and not going out. Jack White is an all time great performer, and he played all of his hits that night including a lot of the biggest songs from the White Stripes discography. I even got to see him do an encour of both Seven Nation Army and Steady as she Goes, which I have been hoping to see for a very long time. The show was a feel-good, exciting time from beginning to end, and is one of the shows I find myself wishing I could revisit! </p>

               <h2>Smino at the Pageant</h2>
               <details>
                  <p>Every year in December, Smino puts on his Kribmas show in St. Louis. These shows are always a ton of fun, we've gone a few times. The 2019 Kribmas at the <a href=https://www.thepageant.com/>Pageant</a> mmmmmmmmmmmwas my favorite one though. That year, there was a fantastic stand up comic for an opener, and Smino came out on stage in a sled built to look like an Air Force One. He performed many of his best songs from his two Albums, as well as earlier deep cuts from his mixtapes. The best part of the show though, was when Smino brought Nelly out on stage and revealed they had a collaboration coming. They also performed Air Force Ones, Ride Wit Me and Country Grammar. </p>

               <h2>Parquet Courts at the Pageant</h2>
               <details>
                  <p>I already linked the Pageant, so here's a link to Parquet Courts <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHfOqqQ1DLQ/>Freebird II</a></p>
                  <p>In March of 2022, me and my friends all went and saw Parquet Courts play at the Pageant. This was such a weird and cool show, Parquet Courts are never afraid to be different or try their hardest, which is a unique aspect of their shows that I don't find very often. You will also find people dancing at a Parquet Courts show rather than moshing, which is very refreshing for a rock show. Parquet Courts are always a good time, and even made me laugh a few times when Andrew Savage forgot the lyrics and made up new ones on the spot. </p>
